# seqcexit
Sequence C exit codes for exiting functions

The following functions calls, with a leading integer argument, are processed by seqcexit:

```c
	exit(130);

	err(131, ...
	verr(132, ...
	ferr(133, ...
	vferr(134, ...

	errp(135, ...
	verrp(136, ...
	ferrp(137, ...
	vferrp(138, ...

	werr(139, ...
	vwerr(140, ...
	fwerr(141, ...
	vfwerr(142, ...
	snwerr(145, ...
	vsnwerr(145, ...

	werrp(143, ...
	vwerrp(144, ...
	fwerrp(145, ...
	vfwerrp(146, ...
	snwerrp(150, ...
	vsnwerrp(150, ...

	warn_or_err(147, ...
	vwarn_or_err(148, ...
	fwarn_or_err(149, ...
	vfwarn_or_err(150, ...

	warnp_or_errp(151, ...
	vwarnp_or_errp(152, ...
	fwarnp_or_errp(153, ...
	vfwarnp_or_errp(154, ...

	printf_usage(155, ...
	vprintf_usage(156, ...
	fprintf_usage(157, ...
	vfprintf_usage(158, ...

	usage(159, ...
```

## Command line

```sh
usage: ./seqcexit.pl [-h] [-v lvl] [-b bottom] [-t top] [-n] [-s] [-c] file.c [file2.c ...]

	-h		print this usage message and VERSION stringand exit 0
	-v lvl		verbose / debugging level (def: 0)
	-b bottom	bottom exit code after wrap around (must be >=0 and < bottom and != 127) (def: 10)
			    NOTE: The sequenced exit codes in file.c can start at 0. The bottom  value
				  only applies when the codes exceed top and need to wrap around.
	-t top		top exit code range (must be > bottom  and < 256 and != 127) (def: 249)
	-n		do not change, nor create files
	-s		keep a copy of the original filenmame as filename.orig.c
	-c		continous sequencing across files (def: always reset code on a new file)

	file.c ...	C source file(s) to process

NOTE: Exit 0 can only be used once at the first exit code use: if bottom  == 0.
      Exit codes > 255 are not used: instead the next code will be set to bottom , or set to 1 if bottom  == 0.
      Exit 127 is not used: instead next value is used: usually 128 unless top == 128 in which case bottom  is used.
```

## Examples

```c
/*ooo*/
```

For example:

```c
    ...
    exit(0); /*ooo*/
}
```

Use this C comment on a line to indicate the exit code on a given line is
new value tp be sued in sequencing.

```c
/*coo*/
```

For example, this will cause seqcexit to reset the sequence number to 100.

```c
    /*
     * firewall
     */
    if (path == NULL) {
	exit(100); /*coo*/
    }
}
```

The exit code that follows will be assigned to 101.
